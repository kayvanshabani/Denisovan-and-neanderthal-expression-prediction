# Denisovan-and-neanderthal-expression-prediction
predicting transcript expression using machine learning
I read SNPs from 1000G and make plink files for each CHR. Then I use our "transcript expression vs sample" dataset to train my model based on FUSION(gusevlab).
Then i will use denisovan and neanderthal VCF files to predict their transcripts' expressions based on their SNPs.
Until now, training is done for almost 40000 transcripts and I am working on test part.
